question: Clear Vegetation to Prepare for Fires
subquestion:  |

  If you want to clear vegetation as part of preparing your property for a fire,
  you do not need to get approval from the Native Vegetation Council or the Country
  Fire Service (except for large trees within 20m of a dwelling).
    
  All you need to do is:
  
  * *Self-assess* that you are clearing vegetation for the purposes of fire prevention.
  
  * *Consider* if there are other practical alternatives to clearing such as trenching that has a width of no more than 5 metres.
  If you are not the landowner, obtain the written permission of the landowner.
  
  * *Clear vegetation* in accordance with any applicable bushfire management plan or another plan for the management of bushfires.
  **(Note: You cannot clear large trees with a trunk circumference greater than 2 meters)**
  
  If your proposed clearance does not meet the requirements described, you can submit a clearance application under Section 28 of the Native Vegetation Act 1991 which can be done [here](${ url_of('apps.environment.sa.gov.au/nvmu/') }){:target="_blank"}.

question: Land Management Information
subquestion:  |
  
  Keeping your home and property well managed throughout the year is essential to bushfire safety. There are different ways to ensure you manage your property for the bushfire season, including clearing of vegetation, management of dwellings, and clearance of flammable and excess items around the home.

  ###Clearance of Vegetation

  Reducing the amount of vegetation on a property is one of the most critical components of preparing for bushfires. However, there are council and statute requirements around the clearing of private land that depend on the size of the land, and whether you can simply clear the vegetation or whether it needs to be burned off.

  There a number of tasks that can be completed without the approval of the
  council or Country Fire Service, including:
  
  * Removal of all leaves, dead branches or vegetation on the ground
  
  * Ensuring all gutters are cleared
  
  * Slashing/mowing of paddocks with as much green waste removed as possible 
  
  * Removal of rubbish away from the home or structures 
  
  * Wood piles are stored away from the home
  
  * Prune tree limbs that are lower than two metres above the ground,
  or overhanging our home

  Importantly, regulations allow you to self-manage vegetation that is within 20 metres of your home, or 5 metres of sheds and garages without a permit.

  ###When to Obtain a Permit

  Permits are required to light a fire, burn off, or operate spark-creating equipment or machinery during the fire-ban season. During the fire ban season, a schedule 9 permit must be applied for. To complete any of the above activities on a complete fire ban day, a schedule 10 permit must be applied for. If a permit is not applied for and granted, and you perform any of the above activities during the fire ban season or on a complete fire ban day, penalties of up to $10,000 and two years of jail or on the spot fines of $315 can be issued.
  
  
  ####How to Apply for a schedule 9 or 10 Permit

  * Permits are free of charge and can be requested by telephone, fax or email from most local councils.
  * Permit applications may be refused by the Authorised Officer if the activity is deemed too risky.
  * An Authorised Officer will assess your application and, if granted, give you a permit number and the specific conditions that apply to your permit.
