subquestion:  |
  ##### This part will be used to explain to the user the legal responsibilities for both parties and their duties.
  ##### Would be useful if we provide a list of things the user can can't do/ask their neighbour to do before contacting the local council or the CFS (unless its an urgent matter)
  ##### Contact details of relevant local council will be displayed depending on the area the land is located in, and probably the CFS where its a matter of urgency
